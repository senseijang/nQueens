#  N-Queens Problem
Andy Jang
CSCI 362 Data Structures and Algorithms

## Goal
The purpose of this program is to solve the N-Queen problem.
The N-Queen problem is a problem describing a situation which you have N queens on a NxN board.
The goal is to place them all on the board without 1 of them conflicting with each other.

## How to Run
Download the .zip file in the repository and extract all of the files.
When using Linux or Git Bash the program can be run with this command:
`make run`
This should auto-compile the cpp file and run it as well.

When the program is run, it'll have a prompt:
`N: `
Any integer value inputted after the N will be the N for the N-queens problem.
